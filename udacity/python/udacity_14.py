# Format practice
# Write two lines of code below, each assigning a value to a variable
car = 'Red Bull Racing'
pilot = 'Max Verstappen'

# Now write a print statement using .format() to print out a sentence and the
# values of both the variables

print("The pilot {} run with car {}".format(pilot, car))
